<Note>Webhooks require the **Enterprise** subscription.</Note>

For PERSCOM, webhooks can be used to enable real-time notifications and data updates for third-party services, such as a messaging platform (for example Slack, Telegram, Discord), an external database (for example Firebase or AWS) or a custom reporting tool. This means that any changes made within PERSCOM, such as new personnel records or updated qualifications, can be automatically communicated to other systems in real-time, without the need for manual data entry or synchronization. This can improve data accuracy and save time for personnel managers and other staff who rely on the system for critical information.

## Creating A Webhook

Webhooks can be managed via your PERSCOM dashboard. Webhooks require a URL that will be notified each time an event takes place that the webhook is subscribed to. Webhooks can either make a `GET` or `POST` HTTP request. Each HTTP request will be signed with a user-defined secret
that may be used to verify that the payload has not been tampered with. The signed signature will be available within the `Signature` header of the HTTP request.

A list of available events that a webhook may subscribe to is located below.
