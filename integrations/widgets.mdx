<Note>Widgets require the **Pro** subscription.</Note>

PERSCOM.io offers powerful widgets that allow the integration of your organizational data into another website for display. Each widget is a
snippet of HTML that can be injected into your website.

## Demo

If you'd like to try the widgets out before using them on your website, you can preview every widget at
[https://widget.perscom.io](https://widget.perscom.io). Please note, you must be subscribed to the **Pro** plan to use this feature. Please
have an API key ready to log in.

<Steps>
  <Step title='Create An API Key'>
    Visit your PERSCOM dashboard and head to the API Key section. Create an API key with access to every scope.
  </Step>
  <Step title='Visit Widget Website'>Visit the widget website [https://widget.perscom.io](https://widget.perscom.io).</Step>
  <Step title='Enter Your API Key'>
    Enter your API key and click a widget to start browsing. Use your back button to get back to the home screen.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Installation

To start using the PERSCOM widget, copy and paste the following HTML snippet into your website. Make sure to **replace** `APIKEY` with your
own API key. Replace the [widget ID](#available-widgets) with ID you'd like to display.

```html Roster Widget {4-5}
<div id="perscom_widget_wrapper">
  <script
    id="perscom_widget"
    data-apikey="APIKEY"
    data-widget="roster"
    src="https://widget.perscom.io/widget.js"
    type="text/javascript"
  ></script>
</div>
```

<Note>
  To avoid leaking sensitive data, it is recommended to create an API key with only `view` permissions. Your API key will be publicly
  accessible.
