# Pricing

PERSCOM.io offers three pricing tiers to fit the needs of any organization: Basic, Pro, and Enterprise. The Basic tier is perfect for those
who need basic personnel management tools without any integration into third-party applications. The Pro tier offers access to our powerful
API, website and widget integration, and the ability to customize your dashboard domain, and access to ticket support. The Enterprise tier
is our top-tier offering, providing the ability to back up and export your data, custom domains, single sign-on (SSO) integration, and
advanced external integration with third-party services via webhooks.

During your demo, you'll have access to all of our features, so you can get a comprehensive look at what PERSCOM.io has to offer. Each tier
is designed to meet the unique needs of organizations and help you manage your personnel effectively and efficiently. Whether you need basic
management tools or advanced integrations, PERSCOM.io has you covered.

With PERSCOM.io, you can scale up or down as needed and enjoy pro-rated pricing. This means you only pay for what you use, and you can
easily adjust your subscription as your needs change.
