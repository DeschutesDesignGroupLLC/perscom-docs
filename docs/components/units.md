# Units

The Units feature in our service allows organizations to clearly define their organizational structure and hierarchy. With this feature,
organizations can create and manage units within their structure, such as departments, divisions, and branches. Personnel can be assigned to
specific units and their roles and responsibilities within the organization can be clearly defined. This feature provides a clear picture of
how personnel fit into the organization, promoting better communication and collaboration. It's an essential tool for organizations looking
to streamline their operations and enhance the efficiency of their personnel management.
