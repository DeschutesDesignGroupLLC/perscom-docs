# Groups

The groups feature enables you to gather and categorize similar units within a unified structure. Each group comprises multiple units,
offering particular advantages when constructing a personnel roster. These groups align with the tabs displayed at the top of a roster, and
within each tab, you'll find the units assigned to that specific group. For further illustrations and examples, you can explore the PERSCOM
[demo](https://demo.perscom.io).
