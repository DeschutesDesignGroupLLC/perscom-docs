# Events

The Events feature works in conjunction with the Calendars feature to help organizations manage and track events more efficiently. With the
Events feature, users can create and manage individual events (e.g. meetings, trainings, drills, etc.) within the context of a larger
calendar. Users can specify the date, time, location, attendees, and other relevant details for each event, and can also set reminders and
notifications to ensure that everyone is informed and prepared. Events can be linked to specific personnel or groups within the
organization, allowing for targeted communication and coordination. The Events feature is designed to work seamlessly with the Calendars
feature, providing a comprehensive solution for event management and scheduling within the PERSCOM.io platform.
