feature, organizations can create custom positions and specify the roles and responsibilities associated with each one. This makes it easy
to track who is responsible for what within the organization and ensures that everyone is aware of their specific responsibilities. The
Positions feature provides organizations with greater visibility into their personnel structure, making it easier to manage and allocate
resources as needed.
