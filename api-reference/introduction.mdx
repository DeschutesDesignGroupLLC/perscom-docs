## Getting Started

<Note>
  Using the PERSCOM API requires a `Pro` subscription. Reach out to support if you need assistance determining if your account supports the PERSCOM API.
</Note>

The PERSCOM API is the backbone that allows PERSCOM to function and deliver the services you've come to enjoy. The API also allows you
to integrate your PERSCOM.io data with third-party services and applications.

The PERSCOM API is built using a RESTful interface. A request to the PERSCOM API requires a HTTP `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, or`DELETE` request along with an API key to an available URL endpoint. A collection of all available endpoints can be found under the`Endpoints` folder.

## Authentication

Requests to the PERSCOM API require the user to verify who they are. The API expects an API Key to be passed via a `Bearer` token in the`Authorization` header of your HTTP request. API Keys can be managed under your PERSCOM dashboard.

## Versioning

In an effort to always provide a powerful and robust API, we've adopted a versioning system to help us roll out regular updates. The API version is defined as a path parameter in the URL. For example:

```
https://api.perscom.io/{version}/users
```

Replace `{version}` with the API version. The current API version is `v2`.

## Caching

The PERSCOM API is backed by a worldwide CDN and cache that allows us to deliver your requests quicker no matter where they originate from. On the dashboard, we handle updating the cache whenever you make a change to your data to make sure you always have access to the most
up-to-date data available. Sometimes, this data can get out-of-sync and a cache purge is necessary. At anytime if you feel the data you are receiving from the API is stale, you can initiate a cache purge from the API section of your PERSCOM dashboard.

## Examples

Below are examples of requests made to the PERSCOM API using different software solutions.

<CodeGroup>
  ```php PHP
  use GuzzleHttp\Client;

  $client = new Client();

  $headers = [
      'Accept' => 'application/json',
      'Authorization' => "Bearer ${apiKey}"
  ];

  $response = $client->request('GET', 'https://api.perscom.io/v2/users', [
      'headers' => $headers
  ]);

  echo 'Status code: ' . $response->getStatusCode();
  ```

  ```js Javascript
  fetch('https://api.perscom.io/v2/users', {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
      Authorization: 'Bearer apiKey',
      Accept: 'application/json'
    }
  })
    .then((response) => {
      console.log('Status code:', response.status)
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      console.error('Error:', error)
    })
  ```

  ```python Python
  import requests

  url = 'https://api.perscom.io/v2/users'
  headers = {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer apiKey',
      'Accept': 'application/json',
  }
  response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

  print(f'Status code: {response.status_code}')
  print(f'Response body: {response.text}')
  ```
